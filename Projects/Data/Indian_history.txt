The Quit India Movement, launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942, was a mass protest demanding an end to British rule in India. It was triggered by the failure of the Cripps Mission and the growing frustration with colonial exploitation. Gandhi’s call for “Do or Die” inspired nationwide strikes, demonstrations, and sabotage of government infrastructure. The British responded with brutal repression, arresting thousands, including Gandhi and other leaders. Despite severe crackdowns, the movement intensified Indian nationalism, paving the way for independence in 1947. It remains a defining moment in India's struggle for freedom.
